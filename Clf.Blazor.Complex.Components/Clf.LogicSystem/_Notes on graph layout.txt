GraphX for .NET is an open-source project which incorporates many layout algorithms separated from the visualization engine.

MSAGL
https://github.com/Microsoft/automatic-graph-layout
The Core Layout engine (AutomaticGraphLayout.dll) contains the core layout functionality. 
Use this library if you just want MSAGL to perform the layout only and afterwards you will use a separate tool to perform the rendering and visalization.
