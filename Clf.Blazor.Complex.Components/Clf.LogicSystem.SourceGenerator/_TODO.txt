Current prototype will break under various circumstances ... need to fix.

*** Properly get the names of all the LogicNode properties !!!

*** Properly avoid mentioning properties that aren't LogicNodes (eg constants)

Handle the case where there are several 'LogicSystemBase' subclasses defined in the project.
The SyntaxReceiver needs to build a collection of Descriptors, one for each LogicSystem encountered.

Purge trailing comments from the formula text.

Move the helper methods in the 'Example_01' demo into LogicSystemBase.

Rationalise the way we're using Reflection/SourceGen to build the dependencies (XX).
Will retain the original 'Reflection' technique, together with the scheme for verifying
that the SourceGen variant gives the same result ; but hide the 'Reflection' variant
behind a #define which removes the original code.

?? Or, remove that completely ??? Maybe eventually, once tested properly.

Handle malformed lambdas eg mentioning properties that are not defined.

Detect when Input nodes not referred to in any Computed node.

Detect circular dependencies - issue a red squiggly diagnostic.

Need to test on larger examples eg D100X.

Retire the D100X version, removing [Formula] ...

Move the examples into a different project.

CLEANUP, SIMPLIFY, RATIONALISE NAMES ETC ...

HANDOVER ?? !!!
